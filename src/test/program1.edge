| Each file has a config section where they can optionally override defaults
begin config
weighted: false
directed: false
edgelabel: false
vertexlabel: false
end


| We can define vertices and represent edges between them like so
B :: b
A :: a
a -> b


| Or for more intricate graphs, a vertex can have edges like so
| Vertex(, Label) ::
| _ Vertex(, Weight)(, Label)
| _ Vertex(, Weight)(, Label)
| This way, you can easily implicitly edges without worrying about identifiers
C :: id
P :: id2
A ::
_ -> C
_ -> P


| Note that in the previous example, :: stores the left-hand vertex in the variable _ by default so we can easily recall it.
| Additionally we can define other vertexes as variables in case users would organize their file differently, like so:

B :: expression
C :: term
F :: factor

expression -> term
term -> factor
expression -> factor
